# InK

Ink is an app which is dedicating to explore the potential of re-building connection between daily tiny moment/scenarios with some unknown/interesting/funny/profound/relevant/inspiring/romantic poem which is generated from machine learning.

## materials

### theory

[Deep Learning](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/deep-learning-101-the-theory-c23a95d1d5cd)

[CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) (size 338 MB)

### dataset

[Kaggle Complete poetryfoundation.org dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/johnhallman/complete-poetryfoundationorg-dataset) (22.32 MB)

### library

[PyTorch and torchVision](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

[Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml)

## milestone

1. test idea by matching image to poem by zero shot learning using CLIP and Kaggle dataset
2. build ios app prototype by using core ml to inference locally or a server to inference remotely with a button to pick photo and a label to display corresponding text
3. make ios app prettier by adding other related functions like poem based map and search etc.
